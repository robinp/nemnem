NemNem - Haskell source hyperlinker.

The goal of NemNem is to take .hs source files and parse crossreference
information. Then hyperlinked HTMLs are made, which ease navigating sources.

To get started with you own (private) codebase:

1) Generate a source list, where each line should be:

<packagename>-<packageversion> <path/to/Some.hs>

You may find some inspiration in pull.hs for this.
Make sure that only a single version of a given package is present, otherwise links get messed up.

2) Using your favourite cabal sandboxing technique:

(optional, if not yet present in bin: cabal install happy alex)
cd nemnem-lib && cabal install
cd nemnem-genstatic && cabal install

Be aware that bounds in .cabal files are pretty arbitrary, might work with lower ones (feel free to make suggestions).

3) Create a directory called 'deploy', and copy contents of resource/static there.

To switch to light theme instead of dark, flip the comments at the top of nemnem.hss and run hss on it (http://ncannasse.fr/projects/hss). Powered by Solarized (http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized). You can of course modify the colors in the css in any other way.

(Yes, you are my build system now, sorry).

4) ./cabal[-sandbox]/bin/nemnem-genstatic <my-source-list.txt>

You need to run this from next to the deploy directory, will put .html files there.
Bug: Might die horribly if a file contains strange encodings. Please report if so.

5) Browse the sources. AST parts not yet supported will be underlined with red.

Please report bugs, but also keep in mind that rough edges (and even missing edges) are expected at this point.
